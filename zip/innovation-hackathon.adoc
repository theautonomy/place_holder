[.highlight-box]
*The Gap:* Teams need intelligent, automated analysis to make faster, safer deployment decisions

[.text-center]
[%step]
[.no-bullet]
* 🔥 GitHub Actions failures cost teams hours of debugging time
* 🎯 Deployment risks are difficult to assess manually
* 📊 Root cause analysis requires deep technical expertise
* ⚡ Time-sensitive production issues demand instant insights
* 🔍 Cross-platform data scattered across GitHub and Jira

== Use Case Scenario

=== Production deployment failed at 3 AM

[%step]
[.feature-card]
[.text-center]
[.no-bullet]
1. 🚨 GitHub Action fails - notification triggers
2. 🤖 AI analyzes 50,000 lines of logs in 5 seconds
3. 🔍 Root cause identified: Database migration conflict
4. 📊 Links to Jira ticket from 3 weeks ago with similar issue
5. 💡 Recommends: Rollback to commit ABC123
6. ✅ Team makes informed decision in minutes vs. hours
